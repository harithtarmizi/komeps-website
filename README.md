# komeps-website
My first industry project to make their project. Me and my supervisor choose a template from youtube and on my first day internship.
I came with a finish template of website. But, 80% of the template was change because there is no UI/UX for this landing page. 
Whatever came across their mind, I need to done it. From there, I learn a lot on how to be a good developer. You must know how to solve a
problem and finish the task on whatever given by your superior. I finish the website in a week before they suddenly want to revamped the website again.
